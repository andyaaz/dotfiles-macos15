# Andy's Dot files on his macbook

mainly consists of program configurations (e.g. vim, zsh, git, etc)

vscode config will not be stored here (instead setting sync is used)

# For my future self

## How to use (correctly)

- git clone anywhere
- create symlinks for config you want to use in home dir locally

## Don'ts

- copy them to home dir (will end up with two diff versions)
- put files with creds in here

## Other settings

- map <control> to <caps lock>
- map <alt> + <space> to alfred/spotlight search
- map <shift> + <space> to dictionary
